# CS-230

The client for this project was The Gaming Room. They wanted a software application called "Draw It or Lose It" that could work on different platforms, not just Android anymore. They needed the design to focus on being able to reuse code and keep the game running smooth across different operating systems.

I think I did a good job laying out the design clearly so that anyone reading it could understand how the game would work. I made sure to organize everything and explain the choices I made for the platform, architecture, and design patterns.

Working through the design document helped me a lot when it came time to think about how I would actually build the code. It forced me to plan everything out ahead of time instead of just jumping in and coding without a clear direction.

If I could revise one part, I would probably add even more detail about how the different parts of the system would connect. I think the overall idea was strong, but adding a little more detail would make it even better.

When designing, I really focused on what the user would need: a fun game that works no matter what device they're using. It's important to think about the user because if the game doesn't work easily for them, they won't want to play it.

My approach to designing the software was to break things down step-by-step and focus on making it simple and easy to understand. In the future, I would probably spend even more time sketching out different options before picking the final design, just to make sure I'm considering everything.
